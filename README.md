# 🤖 Hand Gesture Calculator

This is a real-time **hand gesture-based calculator** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.

It detects the number of fingers and hand gestures via webcam and performs arithmetic operations like:

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division

- MediaPipe detects hand landmarks (fingertips, joints).
- Based on finger patterns, calculator figures out:
  - Numbers (0 to 5)
  - Operators (+, -, ×, ÷)
- Result is shown on screen using OpenCV.
